#Tasks

x take off delay for startup
x preview-display horizontal mirroring
x display other types of images  -> 2x cv windows?
x hist for the rect
x background histos
x flip transformed image
x params for adapt thresh
x options
x proc histo only onshow
x change frame and get histo
x show background_histos
x adaptive y_lim
x why doesnt the hard coded y_hi change for 6th plot?
x make subplot 2 by 3 not 1 by 6
x make a reset of current_tracking_frame force a resize in histos
x display a transform window
x organize function to imports
x pull out np.histogram from updating function
x large blocks to functions
x ptions to a function
x global modify from options-func
x display transform and mask as smaller
x need to get globals set in Options
x pause on a picture for searching for thresh_params

x write rect non-transform
xwrite all to same dir
x write other pics

frame isnt copied?  

tranform and regular img track

do a np.histo work on n
threshold pct array
expand and contract threshold

waitkey switch statement

print in raw_input with carriage return
histo labeled hsv for hsv histos
options for backghisto
do a thresh on each histo
display info in histo title

eval in options
write-out data
build mock images/videos for test
adapt_thresh for saved videos
3rd rgb-plot-pane rect before vs. current "background before ball was there"
search_thresh
do agenda
zeromq messaging for log
run on pi
Q resolve ugly globals code
Q organize imports to and classes

> python adaptive_thresh.py --showbackghisto --showhisto

> set_thresh 80 100 100 130 200 200
150 130 90 200 210 200
100 130 90 200 210 200
0 130 90 100 210 200

speed up histo proc:
    keep it all numpy
    only when updating
    create tests, test data


#Questions

Locate / Track 
    -  how many shapes are there?

#Notes

why current LiveHist is bad
    matplotlib window can't be moved after startup
    makes peview-display jittery
        could this be solved with threading?
    makes cvWaitkeys not responsive

    solution is an html/js app in browser with http interface
