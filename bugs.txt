#Questions

Locate / Track 
    -  how many shapes are there?

#Notes

why current LiveHist is bad
    matplotlib window can't be moved after startup
    makes peview-display jittery
        could this be solved with threading?
    makes cvWaitkeys not responsive

    solution is an html/js app in browser with http interface
