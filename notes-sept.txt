    x run the programs
        python adaptive_thresh.py --showhisto --showbackghisto

warm-ups:
    --startuppause doesnt work in any helpful way

    current_tracking_frame does not update from options

cmds as of Oct 3:

    in options:
        >set_thresh hsv 0 0 0 100 100 100
        >current_thresh
        >unpause_rect   (after waitkey "p")


do-agenda:

    move the frame and underlying bounding box:
        manually, and in a timed pattern
        position and size

    write out stuff:
        -the raw video
        -analytics on the histogram
        -analytics on the mask success
        -analytics on the size
        -> need to structure the code to do read-old vs. real timed

    analytics on the ball are from either freeze-frame or multi-frames
     over some time period

    the histos are for the box, also do the ball position

    thresh on bgr and/or hsv


adaptive-thresh:

    Training

        After collecting a couple images, apply a 95 thresh to each
        then find out the 95 thresh for all the images.

            you only need to collect the bare image itself
            then the processing puts it through hsv, blur, etc

            For pic_i:
                min_color_x <= px_color_x <= max_color_x  | 95% of all px
                thresh-pic_i-color_x = (min_color_x, max_color_x)

            But it's an AND for all three
    
    Analysis
        report how many things in the background fit the thresh, 
         and what size. how about when you alter params like blur-size?

        report what pct of pix within a tracked ball - the estimated circle"
        are in the mask

        report how many frames succesfully tracked the ball
