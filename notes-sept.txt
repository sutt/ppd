up-and-running:
    git basecamp
    x what programs
        adaptive_thresh.py
    x run the programs
        python adaptive_thresh.py --showhisto --showbackghisto

warm-ups:
    --startuppause doesnt work in any helpful way

    current_tracking_frame does not update from options

cmds as of Oct 3:

    in options:
        >set_thresh hsv 0 0 0 100 100 100
        >current_thresh
        >unpause_rect   (after waitkey "p")


do-agenda:

    move the frame and underlying bounding box:
        manually, and in a timed pattern
        position and size

    write out stuff:
        -the raw video
        -analytics on the histogram
        -analytics on the mask success
        -analytics on the size
        -> need to structure the code to do read-old vs. real timed

    analytics on the ball are from either freeze-frame or multi-frames
     over some time period

    the histos are for the box, also do the ball position

    thresh on bgr and/or hsv
