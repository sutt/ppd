Summary of Day1 Learning:


python fbf.py --file file.h264

	press key 'a' to advance thru frames
	
	make sure the codec.dll's are in the folder's path

to play a h264 on the pi:
		omxplayer file.h264
		
	to play at correct speed
		MP4Box -fps files_fps -add file.h264 file.mp4
			(also this shows how many frames)
		omxplayer file.mp4 [--fps desired_fps]

to preview the FOV of cam:
	
	raspistill [-rot 270] [-vf] [-hf] -t 0 -p 200,200,640,480 -w 640 -h 480
		
		(but rotation doesn't work on raspivid)
		
to take a video with raspivid:

	raspivid -w 640 -h480 -ss 5000[ms] -fps 30 -o output.h264 -t 5000[ms] 
	
		(ss and fps are sometimes conflicting, whichever one comes last overwrites)
		
		fps also alters FOV with > 30ish dropping down to half-FOV
		

		
Need to Do:

	Basic Ipython notebook where you:
		display a frame, correct colors
		play the video
		have a way to edit sections of video
		have a storage folder to save them
		
	Output frame by frame
		also for 
	
	Attach a tracking algo
		parameterize for different environments
		
	Benchmarks and Tests
		FP/FN
		Speed
		
	Then we can focus on throwing different samples at it

	No Shutter as of May2014
	
	Setting fps to 0 tells the camera to use dynamic frame rates. You will get 30 fps until your exposure time is too long to archive 30fps. To enforce a fixed frame rates (i.e. 30fps) the maximum shutter speed needs to be limited to 1/fps. All settings of ss over 33333 will be limited to 33333.

	For me here:
	CODE: SELECT ALL
	 raspivid -ISO 100 -ss 1 -fps 0 -o test2.h264

	does give a complete black video.

	
	The problem of setting -ss first and then -exposure is that the exposure settings will overwrite the shutter speed settings.
