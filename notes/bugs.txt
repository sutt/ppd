[x] bug - Why does writevid1.py at framesize 1280,720 get read by VLC correctly? 
          But then at 1920,1080 it records 2x too fast (Even tho larger?)

    -> Makes sense: since there's only half as many frames logged, and expect to be at 30FPS
        it's playing those frames twice as fast as it should.

    [x] let's count frames on each rez

    >python writevid1.py --showvid --time 5 --savedir data/aug2018/misc/ --framesize 1920,1080 --logfps
    data/aug2018/misc/output6.avi :  9621  kb
    numFrames recorded =  83

    >python writevid1.py --showvid --time 5 --savedir data/aug2018/misc/ --framesize 1280,720 --logfps
    data/aug2018/misc/output7.avi :  7926  kb
    numFrames recorded =  141

    >python writevid1.py --showvid --time 5 --savedir data/aug2018/misc/  --logfps
    data/aug2018/misc/output8.avi :  2491  kb
    numFrames recorded =  143

    [ ] Let's investigate this warning message:
    
        [OpenH264] this = 0x05FE2C70, Warning:bEnableFrameSkip = 0,bitrate can't be controlled for RC_QUALITY_MODE,RC_BITRATE_MODE and RC_TIMESTAMP_MODE without enabling skip frame.

    [ ] Let's look at timestamps on vid via VLC


[ ] Can you get faster processing without doing showvid?
[ ] Can you get faster processing with separate thread?
[ ] Can you get steadier perf after waiting fro a warm-up?
[ ] Can we getter better perf with all frames in memory untill end
    [x] This is 32-bit proc => max_size = 2GB?    """ [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 """  
    [ ] calc in-proc size of the frame
    [ ] calc perf time of each component, using time.time and cprofile, timeit


[ ] Might need to add an ffmpeg processing module, e.g. to change frame count, playback fps etc

[ ] Build tests, then exapnd into gui and meta

[ ] Gui's main job, besides start/stop is r/w meta-settings



7/18

[x] basecamp on writevid1, remove cruft

[ ] build some tests for writevid1

[x] build change framesize for writevid1
    [x] toggleframe?
    [x] need to change framesize on VidWrite

[x] camnum arg on writevid1

[ ] put setgain / getcam into camprobe util
    two tests:
     1. setgain prop, see if when you get props it has changed 
     2. take two picture with diff gain and see if one is darker

Other Tasks
[ ] What are commands to check version of opencv, numpy, python, etc
[ ] Separate ReadingFrames from WritingFrames which could make FPS higher (?)




7/17

build PROCESSES!
    well documented
    well tested
    that work together

writevid1.py | fbf2.py  | fdiff1.py

need a summary utility to display file-size, recording-length, frame-size, etc..
    and this should run like 'ls' for all files in directory
need a comparison in size of vid and size of frame between different encoding schemes
need a module for writing a video
need a module for displaying a video

[x] how to eliminate the "windows popup" codec request before writevid1 runs?
    appears to happen for .avi but not h264
    does it happen on mp4?

[ ] need to be able to record different size vids in writevid.py
[ ] set different frame rates
    [ ] verify different frame rates

[ ] get cv2 intellisense in vscode
    [x] it works in ipython
[x] why can't I write out h264 in fdiff1?
    because theres no h264.dll on /data/ path
    [x] try from main ppd/ path - yes, works
    [ ] what happens when you import modules

Modules:
[x] build unique-fn module
[ ] build a set cam params module
[ ] build a show video with time-sleep lag

Scripts:
[ ] build a vid probe util
[ ] build a help function for each script
[ ] build a current_params script which writes current-default-meta-data to meta-data-db on writevid1
[ ] commands.txt becomes a way to run multiple scripts together
[ ] rewrite fbf

Analysises:
[ ] relative size of different codecs
    [ ] for arbitrary videos
    [ ] for vids with just a moving ball
    [ ] half-way between: a person moving and a ball bouncing
    [ ] what does the rpi send best?

Smaller Tasks:
[x] import vidwriter:VidWriter into main scripts
[ ] get all the available codecs by prompt then VidWriter.getcodec()
[ ] variable framesize for videowriter
[x] uniqueFn implement ext=None

[ ] Try Codecs
    [ ] XVID
    [ ] mp4
    [ ] MJPG
    [ ] Lossless

[x] organize video data
[ ] sync data folder with drive

[ ] how to use cursor on opencv windows?
    [ ] to select a region, see fast-tracking video example
    [ ] to select a region to zoom

[x] try out test_vid_sizes
For all three cameras (laptop 1 + 2) & webcam (c920):
(640, 480)   True
(1280, 720)   True
(1280, 960)   False
(1920, 1080)   True

Idea: _CVT_ the fdiff frames to a color close to the ball, then do a diff
        which will let us maximize the diff for only the ball
  





7/9

I need to build a list of tasks and start executing:
I want an example of laptop/pi picture working
then I really want to test that optical flow thing
This seems helpful: fast tracking in opencv
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6rPdRZzgjg
    https://github.com/osmaa/pinymotion/blob/master/pinymotion.py

Questions:
how to play .avi's?
how to play h264's?
how to send h264/other-format over stream?




General Thoughts:
This is a process problem, not a beautiful code problem. Since we don't know how the solution looks at the beginning, we need the processes to iterate there.

Remember, the idea was to use two cameras for mo-cap: one for noticing diffs quickly, the other for precisely locating ball


Worskapce Discoveries:
notes/commands.txt has pi-server instructions
notes/notes-dec.txt has concise and useful info


7/7

build high-level todos
re-run and record main commands

High Level Todos:

Need to build a script that saves videos
Need to create a variety of videos:
    very distant ball
    bouncing ball, 
        different backgrounds
        different fps
    different cameras
    different cam params
Need to create meta data for each recording
Need to build library of videos and frames
A way to run algos onto all test-vids
Need to create unit tests for functionality?
Build a sqlite db that stores settings for thresh levels
    and track-algo params
Do a bunch of exploratory analysis beyond simple-thresh
    optical flow
    edge detection
    circle recognition
Rethink the approach to bounding box: create a circle and add
the area not included as color to absorb
"Find some positive": expand the thresh range to search for a 
small ball

Common Commands:
how to connect ot rpi over socket?
what flags make a difference on adaptive_thresh
fbf works? is valuable tho?

12/16

check the individual times of streaming. Can you read more quickly right at the beginning?

dont print out, does that save time?

x can we read faster if we skip processing? kinda not

different thread to read and record?

Add the streaming to adaptive_thresh

12/1

working well at 10 feet
1280p
rgb: (orange ball) [  0  96 192] [ 88 232 255]
blur 11, repair 2

green sharpie:  [ 15 106  86] [ 81 171 148]

increasing thresh_pct > 0.95 helps with motion blur

11/24

x agenda nextstep triggers them all - sw_ not reset?, or gui firing too much?
x test and debug agenda reset
x it does create a new folder in write_dir for each agenda
x does it reset for a new color ball? yes.
x it takes the first img after reset from the last old_pos for tracking_frame
x two pictures from initial center_tracking frame, make it one
x set the gui from a output_rgb_set
x extend to hsv
x refactor globeGui
x refactor gui to eliminate extraneous
x print output as values
x little wider display
x update gui-hsv-output after runIterThreshA
x verify that thresh_pct is different
x better printout for solves
x less verbose
x have outcome stats display
x Proof-of-Concept: do iterThresh with 1 training image, then multiple training images
x better perf? - yes
x at least wider thresh? -yes
x call iterThreshB from gui
x tracking params from gui
x agenda.combine_threshes: transformA(img.copy(), blur = 1, b_hsv = True)

iterThreshB outputs initthresh? Not exactly but still seems sketchy

Show-How-Far-You-Can-See-Ball
x tracking success displayed to output
x display shows wide circle around putative ball
also diagnose iterThreshB on 
also display radius and num_of_cnts_found on display

Most important:

    Resize

    File_Cam


Can do an iterthreshB agenda creating a mask where there are FP's?

do the tracking without resize
find a way to know if it sees anything and what width?
    "is it seeing the ball way out there? What's the furthest it can see the ball?"

Q does a switch statement make waitkey more responsive?
Q resolve ugly globals code
Q organize imports to and classes

speed up histo proc:
    keep it all numpy
    only when updating
    create tests, test data


#Questions

Locate / Track 
    -  how many shapes are there?

#Notes

why current LiveHist is bad
    matplotlib window can't be moved after startup
    makes peview-display jittery
        could this be solved with threading?
    makes cvWaitkeys not responsive

    solution is an html/js app in browser with http interface
