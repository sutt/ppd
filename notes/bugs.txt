    [ ] more tests
        [x] show score_display with w/ only tracking
        [D] draw tracking onto score_display
        [x] modulo zero on show_tracking
            [x] get data
        [ ] new pattern with if statements

    [ ] build data
        [ ] 3 bounce vids
            [ ] background
            [ ] agent no ball
            [ ] bounce

    [ ] post data
        [ ] repo inside repo, test with dummy repo

    [ ] process data
        [ ] add some rays for bounce

    [ ] add documentation
        [ ] add repo
        [ ] add readme
        [ ] jupyter notebooks for:
            [ ] guiview
            [ ] guirecord
            [ ] timelog
            [ ] adaptive thresh

11/5

    [x] tracking is broken:
        [x] figure out how to use git to revert to a working time
            git checkout  5c40a25ab2046125d6ded4c1b30d0bf675f1f60b
            (git checkkout master reverts this)
        [x] debug it:
            demo-proc/output4.avi -> breaks w/ only --track
            -> works with --track and --showscoring
        [ ] it doesn't error, but it doesn't show score_display either:
            ->need to separate window three logic from --showscoring (which should be 
                just for displaying metalog-score data)
        [x] add test to cement it

    [x] better verifyAction

    writing tests for stockfish
    http://tests.stockfishchess.org/tests

11/2
    [x] test_show_score_on_off_1() basic run pass
    [ ] then do with arg
    [ ] then re-run with if-blocks

    [x] this could get annoying if we need to constantly update benchmark in tests
        -> need an automated re-bench function for each test

    [x] next commit
        [x] pattern dif folder
        [x] collect 2nd test data
        [x] 2nd test
        [x] rebench pattern
            [x] test rebench

    
    [x] verify in ipython theres actual diffs b/w test images: no, so is staging func wrong?
    [x] why is viz_diff showing diffs wrong?
    
    [x] why does test_show_scoring not work? on which alleged asserts?
        [x] need to re-collect the data all based off 1-video

    notes:
        good np primer
        https://realpython.com/numpy-array-programming/

        [ ] why doesn't pytest enter __name__ == "__main__"

11/1

    [ ] guiview_test - split into staging module
        [ ] this allows us to develop staging routine better
        [ ] better develop file delete routines
        [ ] better develop reading the test data file as function
        [ ] asserts in tests should not be wrapped in try
    [x] controldisplay_test -> split
        [x] controldisplay_staging
        [x] helperfunctions


10/31

    [ ] build test pattern for display, framefactory, etc
        [x] display pattern
            [ ] _test_get_frame, other test helper methods
        [ ] tests:
            [ ] view scoring
                [x] main_display
                [ ] score_display
            [ ] view hand-drawn selection
            [ ] view zoomFrame
            [ ] allowduplicates=off and try to add duplicates; try with back-and-forth
        [ ] sections for display testing: Class-level tests, Method-level tests

    [ ] single command to run all the tests
        [ ] see chess workspace, but not the .bat

    [ ] finally, refactor vidwriter and miscutils

    [ ] experimental vids

10/30

    [x] reset display.outputScore
        [x] add this to test_write_score
    [x] gui. annotate obj: reverse radio labels
    [x] add test write_adv_score
        [x] and added write_score details
    [x] add test custom_framelog_1
        [x] document the git diff for documentation in guiview_test
            git diff 27b57b3 44d6aa7
    [~] add test custom_framelog_2
        custom-framelog does not work on proc'd vids?
            -> b/c you need to overwrite in framenote.jsonc
    [x] add test edit_framenote:
        [x] try with param edit while also new scoring
        [x] make sure old scoring does not get lost
        [~] try with back-and-forth, are originals note edits preserved? no they are not
    [x] add test edit_framenote_override
        [x] try with back and forth
        [x] try with scoring, is it overwritten, is it preserved?


    Thinking of more tests:
        [ ] orientation, selectZoom selectROI on these
        [ ] resizing zoomFrame / scoreFrame
        [ ] preload vs semiload

    Misc Features:
        [ ] framenote-override doesn't ADD to framenote (only overwrites). Change this?
                see: guiview_test:test_override_framenote

    List of other bugs, features:
        [ ] draw_ray( bOffSetRay)
        [ ] TODO-SS in trackFactory - not truly multi-object yet
        [ ] trackAlgo: trackLargestDiffInDesignatedRect
                a bounce can be found via largest diff, but sometimes background diffs
                will be larger, therefore we can rule those out with
                a hand-drawn rect deignates the areas where the bounce will occur,
                this can be encoded as say obj4?

10/29

    [x] display.circleTrack -> trackScore
    [x] trackFactory: multi object tracking

    [x] build a new test
    [x] add display to all stubs and all mocks in guiview
    [ ] get a recipe for debug where you can write to file a display window's state
        in outputConsole: from modules.TestHelpers import outputDisplayState(args)
        then call outputDisplayState or something
        or just write it as a method in Display class
        -> use this for matching display state



10/26

    [x] annotate enums
        [x] get color correct on display.outputObjs
    [x] trackFactory scoreSchema
        [x] "#TODO-SS" is still commented here
    [x] does deleting __init__ in test/ matter? to debug? or pytest?
    [x] build some tests
    [ ] investigate the bugs
    [ ] consolidate test runs with a script


10/25
    [x] cli for obj to show in score_display
        [x] does this throw an error if object is wrong?
    [ ] vertical score_display is too large
        [x] test this
        [ ] fix this
    [x] need to reset display.outputScore so we 
        [x] a) don't rewrite an old score onto new frame?
        [x] b) don't have a cluttered view
    [~] file debug import/step-into from root/test/
        [~] reproduce: CAN'T
            KEY: it only works when you don't call with erroneous arg's
    [x] file output-panel pop-up bug
        [x] reproduce in blank workspace
        [ ] file the bug

            How to reproduce:
                in scratch/ create a new folder: demo_popup/
                create a file called demo.py in demo_popup/
                open demo.py:
                    import os, sys
                    def foo():
                        x=1
                        return x
                save file
                do to another file in editor, but leave demo.py oepn as a tab
                go into explore, close the exapnded demo_popup/ folder
                then delte that folder
                should cause:
                [Error - 6:30:21 PM] One or more errors occurred. (failed to parse file file:///c:/Users/wsutt/Desktop/files/ppd/ppd/scratch/repro_popup/demo.py)


10/24

    [x] finish display.show() roi Zoom
    [x] display.drawOntoPane() add coordRelative switch statement
    [~] selectROI for ray should be selectFromCenter = True (4 places to ammend code in display.show())
    [x] remove Legacy-SS
    [x] scoreRect for rays, scoreRect for dif objEnum's
    [ ] build new demo-proc's with scoringschema in their metalog

    [ ] investigate "#Bug- does this need rotate_bounds as below?"
    [ ] investigate "#?# self.frame = imutils.rotate_bound(self.frame, - self.orientation)"
    [ ] investigate "#BUG-check if zoomRect is in bounds in new video"

    [x] annotate enums to obj's

    Notes:
        display.roiRect holds display.outputScore (hand drawn markers)
        display.roiRectScoring holds displau.inputScore (read from notes)

10/23

    [ ] Enumerate Tests:
        
        Display:
            types of tests / questions:
                - Compare image ANSWER to method result
                    for drawing, zooming, cropping, etc
                - How to avoid selectRoi?

            test instances:
                [ ] Test zoom on rotation, is zoomFrame correct?
                [ ] draw_ray w/w/o bOffset
        
        guirecord <-> guiview
        [ ] record -> benchmark -> view (tests encoding/decoding codec)
        [ ] create synthetic benchmark: np.zeros(x,x,x)+cv2.draw and then load

        [ ] writeFrame bDuplicate overriding frameData w/w/o score
        [x] scoring output
            [x] just from display
            [x] just from notes
            [x] a merge of notes and display (update/add)
        [ ] modulo zero stuff


    [ ] Misc Thoughts:
        [ ] All those imports needed in guiview?
        [ ] h264 encoding will change if frames are skipped (?)
        [ ] sync framerate by pointing webcam at screen
        [ ] build a ["realtime"] timeout tracking fucntion wrapper:
            tracking processes untill time's up; returns best result
            available at that time: e.g. 27 different thresholds
        [ ] how to test roiSelect()?
            in stub set a param on Display .bTesting
        [ ] profile startup time to reduce it (+ tests run faster?)

    [ ] VScode/misc:
        [~] indentation in controlflow_test.py is wrong; fix
            maybe b/c copy from notepad a json?
        [x] can't step into import for debug controlflow_test.py
            a cwd thing? no: we need to copy test function to root level to get debug
        [ ] how to assign hotkeys to debug tasks?
            [ ] launch a particular file
            [ ] launch with
            [ ] assign breakpoints before running debug
            [ ] clear all breakpoints


10/22

    [x] ScoreSchema

        Checkpoints:
        [x] Run thru with same functionality
        [ ] Add functionality:
            [x] Draw multiple objects/object-types from inputScore/outputScore
            [x] Assign multiple object/object-types with gui+display
            [x] add scoreSchema to TrackFactory, and then to display.drawTrackers()

        [x] Additional Features:
            [x] assign a particluar obj enum to be zoomed-in in scoreDisplay
                [x] call from cli, parser

        [x] Refactors:
            [x] remove roiRect, roiRectScoring
                keep: scoreRect, zoomRect

        Manual Testing:
            [~] legacyload -output-> ScoreSchema (doesn't work)
            [x] view multiple objects
            [x] view ray object
            [x] draw multiple object
            [x] draw ray object
            [x] view multi and single scores
                [x] add a new score obj
                [x] overwrite existing scores
            [~] view trackers as scoreSchema
        
        Bugs/Refactor:
        [~] output.writeFrame() should have separate arg for framenote scoring
        [x] display.outputScore.reset() called
            [x] needs to only reset other objects (?)
        [x] frameData json can't use int's for dict keys

10/19

    [x] override frame attr:
        [x] build into gui
        [x] run with hard coded edit, mergeDict off
        [x] write mergeDicts
        [x] test mergeDicts
        [x] demo on a proc'd video
            [ ] can this override score delibeartely? inadvertantly?
        [x] add framenote-override.jsonc to .gitignore, guiview.jsonc too

    [ ] write-up workflow to commands.txt
        [ ] initial processing: use guiview.jsonc to write params
        [ ] re-processing: 
            [ ] add hand scoring - new or modified
                [ ] how you ran rewind even after write
                [ ] why to turn "dup's on" to off
            [ ] edit individual frames with framenote.jsonc
                e.g. ball_occluded
            [ ] batch edit params in existing framenote
                e.g. approx_distance
            [ ] how you can run with track=on to see where it fails to find, 
                and score that as a challenge frame
            [ ] deleteframes.py script
    
    [x] deleteframes script
    [~] undo button - remove previous frame written to output in vid, timelog, metalog
        [~] this can be recursive
        [~] retreat a frame on completion
        Notes:
            reset frameFact, timeFact, notesFact, outputFact (?)
            maybe just write a script that deletes frame(s),
            and you can even manually delete timelog, metalog entries

    [x] build scoring schema:
        [x] multi objects per frame
        [x] scoring types: 
        [x] how will this work with gui?
        [x] a ball diff is "two points" beginning and end
        Notes:
            scoring is used for multiple things:
                read-in from metalog
                from display -> metalog
                tracking evaluation
            how does alterframe do both tracking and scoring?
                b/c it's only building scoreRect which is for scoreFrame
                Display: roiRectScoring, circleTrack keep track of points

            we need a schema for score:



10/16

    [x] throw informative messa.ge: when no --dir and no --file 
    [x] cleanup notes / refresh concepts / fix tiny bugs
    [x] manually test tracking_params edit
        output4, frame154 fails to track, alter param: 
        "thresh_hi": [74, 255, 255]  (from 64,255,255) and it finds ball
    [x] manually try changing a framenote on a proc'd video
        works for changing a note-attr, but not scoring

    [ ] Still lack features to alter framenotes on proc'd vid:
        [x] Can't easily batch alter a param, need to do indv each frame
        [x] Can't change score to new params with gui-roi
        [ ] Can't apply track as score
            [ ] add score_type: 'track-score'
        [x] Need multiple scores for multi-object tracking
        [~] An undo button for last frame proc
            [~] recursively this is just remove last frame
        [x] We writeframes even when they're duplicates with Writeframe-On;
            don't do this b/c we want to forward reverse while proc-ing
        [x] Need to advance on writeFrame / writeScore

        TODO:
            [x] reorder gui
            [x] gui don't write duplicate frames; default on
                [x] not correct: we still want to overwrite a frame
                [x] gui -> main
                [~] still not quite correct: can't overwrite a framenote attr
                    when that framenote has a score
            [x] refactor outputFact to setCmd()
            [x] advance on writeFrame
            [~] blink on press of write frame
            [ ] add button: writef + track as score
                [ ] add functionality
            [x] add button: overwrite the param(s) for all
                [x] add functionality
                [x] how to do nested json update into nested dict
            

    [ ] evaluation function
        [ ] error function - diff (x,y); diff radius
            [ ] diff color - 95% pixels in some range
        [ ] TP/FP/TN/FN - for whole video

    [ ] ipython output
        [ ] current frame img
        [ ] current frame notes
        [ ] zoom frame (coords and img)
        [ ] tracker params
        [ ] tracker stored data
        [ ] tracker previous position
        [ ] tracker diff

    [ ] output various transforms of frame onto window3, etc

    [ ] apply iterThreshB

    Other possible bugs to be investigates:
    
        FrameFactory.getFrameSize doesn't use frameOrig for shape:
            is this causing output video to have wrong orientation?


10/10

    [x] Fix zoom_display logic
        we want to be able to do zoom in the course of --track and --showscore

        [x] isolate the problems:

        [x] fix with refactor
            [x] hello windowThree
            [x] zoomOff should apply to windowThree; right now it disables winTwo
                [x] refactor zoomOff -> scoreOff
                [~] refactor alterZoomFrame -> alterSubFrames

        [x] manually test for regressions

    [ ] Add ipython module
        [ ] sockets module, just a server?

    [ ] .tracklog output

    [ ] evaluation 

    [ ] build more videos
        [ ] blank background / with person-no-ball
        [ ] with a bounce

    [ ] cython for circle_pix

10/9

    [ ] trackTimer
        [ ] output
        [x] to gui

    [x] trackParams
        [x] modularized
        [x] read/write from json
        [x] reset default
    

10/7

    lots of copy()'s occur throughout trackFrame pipeline:
        can these be turned off for optimal track perf?
        what do we lose by eliminating them? e.g. writeout ability?

10/6 

    [ ] build filter_pix_circle in ipython
        [x] good demo cell on generated image
        [ ] demo on frame0 of output4 with score rect
        [~] build sruare_inside_circle
        [x] convert pix_list to be accepted by iterThreshA img arg

    [x] add filter_pix_circle to TrackFactory
        [x] convert pix_list to be accepted by iterThreshA img arg

    [ ] Add same img processing (as are applied in track) to training images
        before running iterThreshA

10/5

    [x] add a --startplay for debugging

    [ ] we can pre-train tracker and write output to .tracklog

    bugs:
        [x] output7.avi - frame 220 has a a zoom_img with width=0, breaks
        [x] output7.avi - frame 223, can't retreat frame

10/3 - 10/5

    [ ] build training video on output8.avi

    [ ] add tracking algo module

        [x] basic tracking
            [x] show in main window
            [x] show in zoom window
                [ ] show last zoomWindow when track fails
            [x] add cli option

        [x] does it write; size > x
        [x] can it advance without writing?
        [ ] does it match a premade vid? only certain frames, only certain contguous frame regions

        [x] frame json onto metalog
            [x] does it update each time on disk?
                [x] this could be slow? (0.015 secs at most)
            [x] viewable with tail? (yes)

    [ ] open an existing video file, write new frames to it:
        this could be useful for adding additional training frames after experiment

    [x] Testing guiview
        [x] add tests/
        [x] add template for tests on guiview
        [x] add structure of tests to guiview

            since we're running in Popen we need to write out data to tmp file
            or do we? we can do asserts within mock_test() and raise an error and capture in stderr on the console?

        [ ] build a test_timeout function on a thread
        
        [ ] try some of the features in vscode:
            https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/unit-testing

        do this?
            warnings.filterwarnings('error')
    
    [x] why does pause_on_first_frame opens show frame_i:1 (not 0?)
        [x] and you have t=.03 not(t=0) ?

    [x] frame delay radio above fn on gui

    [x] add slowdown value

    [x] refactor updateGui into by-vid and by-frame


9/19

[x] diagnose gui issues:

    The key was to call build_gui_c() in thread-inheriting class's __init__:
    That way the self of myGui/BuildGuiC can refer to tk elements 
    populated in build_gui_c()

    [x] is this why debug didn't work?

        no, debug (with gui) still fails to recover from pause: both tkinter 
        and opencv windows become unresponsive. And hitting puase again doesn't work

        [ ] Can this debugger handle an arbitrary second thread
        [ ] Can this debugger handle a tkinter second thread with no globals?
            if so, replace globals with queues

        [ ] One way to fix threading is to have main thread call get() from guiInterface
    
    [ ] Implement queue for globals? 
        https://pymotw.com/2/Queue/
    
    here's where the code was lifted:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/459083/how-do-you-run-your-own-code-alongside-tkinters-event-loop
    
[x] Refactor:
    [x] remove vars from GlobalsC
    [x] refactor frameFactory updateGui into own class in GuiC
    [x] remove old issues from guiview head-notes
    
[ ] Refactor - rename and move vidwriter and miscutils to modules
    [ ] refactor their imports
    [ ] keep tests running

[x] exit opencv window on gui close

    [x] extra radio buttons -11:15
    [x] initial gui config
    [x] pause on open
    [x] directoryFactory

[x] add to guiview to commands.txt  -11:15
[ ] write a narrative-log entry     -11:15

[ ] investigate advanced features:
    [ ] shortcut keys tkinter
        [ ] do you need forcus on a particular button for them to register
        [ ] or do we need to register them to opencv window?
    [ ] ROI selection

[ ] build intermediate features on guiview:
    [ ] output image/video
    [ ] read images
        [ ] go into subdirectories

[ ] still need testing on guirecord

[ ] I would like some multi-thread safe data structures, jeez these crashes
    and can't debug; do they fix?

[ ] build guiview.py like (fbf2.py)

    [x] check if that basic app structure can be debugged?
        must debug guiview and GuiC separately, 
        run debug config: guiview-main for launch with --nogui

    [ ] gui features
        [ ] get keypress in tkinter
        [ ] zoom in on vid window

    [x] slowdown frames with timelag

    [x] annotate filename on video

    [ ] Note: arrow keys and mouse are used for both scoring (drawing a ground truth circle)
              and for zooming
    
    [ ] separate gui for hand scoring the data
        [ ] create a .scorelog files
            - could be testing whether algo has found the correct obj
            - could be the ground-truth for where the ball is
            - indexed by frame_num
    
    [ ] separate function for drag/select ROI, and processing of that ROI 
        (e.g. create seed thresh-hold)

    [x] --dir to go thru all vids
        [ ] a dir box

    [ ] a settings sqlite db to hold last settings
        [ ] directory
        [ ] zoom settings - ROI

    [ ] do images too

    [x] display on gui
        [x] frame num
        [x] time t=
        [ ] time since last frame

    [ ] display metadata / notes:

    [ ] --dir to probe all file in a dir
        [ ] -r recursively probe
    [ ] list
        [ ] num frames
        [ ] running time according to frametimelog
        [ ] file size
        [ ] frame size
        [ ] some description/notes
        [ ] date modified
        [ ] encoding

    filter by criteria:
        [ ] criteria in notes (e.g. ball_present = True)
        [ ] criteria of num_frames, etc

    [ ] works for images too


[ ] Build mock tests for guirecord and timelog

    a test function will call guirecord in a subprocess with cmd args:
    these cli args override initial states of globals at beginning of script
    a warm up period is given to check in body, then cmd_record_on is called
    and at end of num_record_frames you go to exit,
    this creates vid and log files in the test directory of choice
    then you load the data from these files into test function and do:
     - asserts on various stats of the data
     - display/graph the benchmark vs test data in ipython

Note: tracking in guiveiw is really tracker.score(current_frame). 
      But what we're really looking for "seed" / training img before that
      train the image to later i.d. it scoring frame:
      train_img.append(img1)
      train_img.append(img2)
      tracker.train(train_imgs)
       ->
      tracker.score(current_frame)

[x] bug - Why does writevid1.py at framesize 1280,720 get read by VLC correctly? 
          But then at 1920,1080 it records 2x too fast (Even tho larger?)

    -> Makes sense: since there's only half as many frames logged, and expect to be at 30FPS
        it's playing those frames twice as fast as it should.

    [x] let's count frames on each rez

    >python writevid1.py --showvid --time 5 --savedir data/aug2018/misc/ --framesize 1920,1080 --logfps
    data/aug2018/misc/output6.avi :  9621  kb
    numFrames recorded =  83

    >python writevid1.py --showvid --time 5 --savedir data/aug2018/misc/ --framesize 1280,720 --logfps
    data/aug2018/misc/output7.avi :  7926  kb
    numFrames recorded =  141

    >python writevid1.py --showvid --time 5 --savedir data/aug2018/misc/  --logfps
    data/aug2018/misc/output8.avi :  2491  kb
    numFrames recorded =  143

    [ ] Let's investigate this warning message:
    
        [OpenH264] this = 0x05FE2C70, Warning:bEnableFrameSkip = 0,bitrate can't be controlled for RC_QUALITY_MODE,RC_BITRATE_MODE and RC_TIMESTAMP_MODE without enabling skip frame.

    [ ] Let's look at timestamps on vid via VLC


[ ] Can you get faster processing without doing showvid?
[ ] Can you get faster processing with separate thread?
[ ] Can you get steadier perf after waiting fro a warm-up?
[ ] Can we getter better perf with all frames in memory untill end

7/17

build PROCESSES!
    well documented
    well tested
    that work together

writevid1.py | fbf2.py  | fdiff1.py

need a summary utility to display file-size, recording-length, frame-size, etc..
    and this should run like 'ls' for all files in directory
need a comparison in size of vid and size of frame between different encoding schemes
need a module for writing a video
need a module for displaying a video

[x] how to eliminate the "windows popup" codec request before writevid1 runs?
    appears to happen for .avi but not h264
    does it happen on mp4?

[ ] need to be able to record different size vids in writevid.py
[ ] set different frame rates
    [ ] verify different frame rates

[ ] get cv2 intellisense in vscode
    [x] it works in ipython
[x] why can't I write out h264 in fdiff1?
    because theres no h264.dll on /data/ path
    [x] try from main ppd/ path - yes, works
    [ ] what happens when you import modules

Modules:
[x] build unique-fn module
[ ] build a set cam params module
[ ] build a show video with time-sleep lag

Scripts:
[ ] build a vid probe util
[ ] build a help function for each script
[ ] build a current_params script which writes current-default-meta-data to meta-data-db on writevid1
[ ] commands.txt becomes a way to run multiple scripts together
[ ] rewrite fbf

Analysises:
[ ] relative size of different codecs
    [ ] for arbitrary videos
    [ ] for vids with just a moving ball
    [ ] half-way between: a person moving and a ball bouncing
    [ ] what does the rpi send best?

Smaller Tasks:
[x] import vidwriter:VidWriter into main scripts
[ ] get all the available codecs by prompt then VidWriter.getcodec()
[ ] variable framesize for videowriter
[x] uniqueFn implement ext=None

[ ] Try Codecs
    [ ] XVID
    [ ] mp4
    [ ] MJPG
    [ ] Lossless

[x] organize video data
[ ] sync data folder with drive

[ ] how to use cursor on opencv windows?
    [ ] to select a region, see fast-tracking video example
    [ ] to select a region to zoom

[x] try out test_vid_sizes
For all three cameras (laptop 1 + 2) & webcam (c920):
(640, 480)   True
(1280, 720)   True
(1280, 960)   False
(1920, 1080)   True

Idea: _CVT_ the fdiff frames to a color close to the ball, then do a diff
        which will let us maximize the diff for only the ball
  





7/9

I need to build a list of tasks and start executing:
I want an example of laptop/pi picture working
then I really want to test that optical flow thing
This seems helpful: fast tracking in opencv
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6rPdRZzgjg
    https://github.com/osmaa/pinymotion/blob/master/pinymotion.py

Questions:
how to play .avi's?
how to play h264's?
how to send h264/other-format over stream?




General Thoughts:
This is a process problem, not a beautiful code problem. Since we don't know how the solution looks at the beginning, we need the processes to iterate there.

Remember, the idea was to use two cameras for mo-cap: one for noticing diffs quickly, the other for precisely locating ball

build high-level todos
re-run and record main commands

High Level Todos:

Need to build a script that saves videos
Need to create a variety of videos:
    very distant ball
    bouncing ball, 
        different backgrounds
        different fps
    different cameras
    different cam params
Need to create meta data for each recording
Need to build library of videos and frames
A way to run algos onto all test-vids
Need to create unit tests for functionality?
Build a sqlite db that stores settings for thresh levels
    and track-algo params
Do a bunch of exploratory analysis beyond simple-thresh
    optical flow
    edge detection
    circle recognition
Rethink the approach to bounding box: create a circle and add
the area not included as color to absorb
"Find some positive": expand the thresh range to search for a 
small ball

Common Commands:
how to connect ot rpi over socket?
what flags make a difference on adaptive_thresh
fbf works? is valuable tho?

check the individual times of streaming. Can you read more quickly right at the beginning?

dont print out, does that save time?

x can we read faster if we skip processing? kinda not

different thread to read and record?

x test and debug agenda reset
x it does create a new folder in write_dir for each agenda
x does it reset for a new color ball? yes.
x it takes the first img after reset from the last old_pos for tracking_frame
x two pictures from initial center_tracking frame, make it one
x set the gui from a output_rgb_set
x extend to hsv
x refactor globeGui
x refactor gui to eliminate extraneous
x print output as values
x little wider display
x update gui-hsv-output after runIterThreshA
x verify that thresh_pct is different
x better printout for solves
x less verbose
x have outcome stats display
x Proof-of-Concept: do iterThresh with 1 training image, then multiple training images
x better perf? - yes
x at least wider thresh? -yes
x call iterThreshB from gui
x tracking params from gui
x agenda.combine_threshes: transformA(img.copy(), blur = 1, b_hsv = True)

iterThreshB outputs initthresh? Not exactly but still seems sketchy

x tracking success displayed to output
x display shows wide circle around putative ball
also diagnose iterThreshB on 
also display radius and num_of_cnts_found on display

    File_Cam


Can do an iterthreshB agenda creating a mask where there are FP's?

do the tracking without resize
find a way to know if it sees anything and what width?
    "is it seeing the ball way out there? What's the furthest it can see the ball?"

    create tests, test data


#Questions

Locate / Track 
    -  how many shapes are there?

#Notes

why current LiveHist is bad
    matplotlib window can't be moved after startup
    makes peview-display jittery
        could this be solved with threading?
    makes cvWaitkeys not responsive
