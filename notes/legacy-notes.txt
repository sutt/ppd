guiview.py ---------

    [ ] refactor gui to not use globals, instead thread-safe
        [ ] does this enable debugging better?
        

    [ ] functionality
        [ ] i/o images
        [x] delete frame(s) from a video via script:
        [~] add --semiload flag for --dir runs. (it's just --preload)
        [ ] filter videos played via metalog props
        [ ] filter frames played via metalog props
        [ ] add other file extensions for vids

    BUGS:
        [ ] pauseTime - doesn't account for when called with no-delay
        [~] "a" won't start a new video on preload (output4), but will on semiloaded (output7)
        [~] gui display for track timer is -1 even with --tracktimer, when turned on via 
            gui instead of via --track


AnalysisHelpers.py ----------

    
    [ ] inWindowCheck() returns True if trackScuess and center is
        in window
    [ ] add unit tests
    [ ] subprocColorPlot runs from jupyter instead of cmd-line

ControlDisplay.py ---------------

Features: 

    [ ] New resize method for when score_display wants to be vertical

Refactors:

    [ ] only build "n/a" zoom frame once
    
    [ ] add unittests, can't test with guiview_test
        [ ] test for coord conversion between zoom and main
        [ ] test an actual image for cutting pixels
            [ ] show pixel blending on the border
        [ ] test for resize behavior
        [ ] test mod0 vs not-mod0

Bugs:
    [ ] how to cancel an roi request?
    [ ] on --file, after reopen file zoomOn is off so zoom_display is frozen
    [ ] can't z/x zoom unzoom with tracking roi
    [ ] in a --dir run, old zoomframe can be OOB for new vid's frames
        "#BUG-check if zoomRect is in bounds in new video"

DataSchemas.py ----

 [ ] score_types as training vs challenge


Interproc.py -------

     build a prototype for interproc communication

    Ideas:

        Ultimately, need a list of these frames

    Dataset:

        lag intervals
        
        tracker-state

    Need Common operations methods on 

        GuiviewState.get_zoom_window()

        and operations like show multiple frames in 1-img

    TODOs

        [x] db interface class
            [x] open a connection
        [X] add to gui
        [x] add functionality to guiview
        [x] test w/ ipy
        [ ] add pathToData() function (see chess workspace)
        [x] add id as primary_key increment function (?)
        [ ] test that ScoreSchemas load from pickle?
        [ ] add datetime to state_tbl
            [ ] then helper function like get all from 'last 30 seconds'

SearchParams.py -------

    TODOs:
        [ ] buildGradient -> combineThreshes -> doesn't work
            for combinations with multiple indexes
            [ ] need to decompose the tuple into 
                thesh_lo_r, thesh_lo_g, etc. then recompose before
                setting trackParams
