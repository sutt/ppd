Found issues with slower than 30 FPS when 1920 and recordOn = True. Multiple options have been added to gui to deal with this:
    codec       - prompt allows
    buffer      - on save frames to memory and only writes to disk 
                  at end-of-record / out of memory
    log type -   simple log (1 col of framerate data) only outputs saved frames data;
                  detailed log (multi col) outputs frames before

    To do:
    [ ] add no-loss option to gui


    Notes:
     - can use detailed log, with timelog.py --filtervar recordOn --filterval True
       to debug slow fps
    - if, simple-log with timelog.py --skip 1 --hz is off


Explored compression and loss in books/compare-compression-frames.ipynb:
    png is lossless
    jpg is different encoding from h264
    diff is ~ 25% of pixels ?

    -> we now have strategies for dealing with compression alterations

    Todo:
    [ ] What is time to process each size image?

guirecord.py is pretty well positioned for it's use. As of yesterday we established frame rate is constant across different different gui options and framesizes. Also record does not delay framerate on laptop cam. (Still to try: logitech and picam)
    
    To remember:
    - use timelog.py to check summary stats on fps data
    - use b_timelog, b_log_vars in guirecord to affect logging behavior

    To do:
    [ ] apply guirecord to logitech and picam (both as streaming and local)

But one thing to notice is that a compressed video frame is smaller and thus less detailed than uncompressed frame. But we do live processing on (in memory) uncompressed frames. So, the live tracking algo could differ in performance from the saved version. We need a way to save uncompressed frames and make them a video.

    To do:
    [x] check that a compressed frame is different than uncompressed
    [x] how to check the size of each in 
    [x] how to save in opencv
    [ ] or do cv2.imsave() of each frame; use ffmpeg to make vid


    Notes:
    b_codec = True can allow a pop-up where you select 
    
    @680
        72  Mb 2sec uncompressed     - output12
        0.5 Mb 2sec h264-compressed  - output11
        but, no slowdown in framerate

    @1920
        400 Mb 2 sec uncompressed     - output13
          7 Mb 2 sec h264-compressed  - output14
        and yes, definetly down possibly 40% in framerate

        Questions:
            [ ] does my opencv use "system ffmpeg" or only the ffmpeg.dll on the path in rootdir; and does this matter?
            [ ] how to get the vid's enconding from ffmpeg?

Idea for how to track model perf:

    git-commit  algo-main       y-0     y-1     truth-y0    err-0-y0  time-perframe

    current     long-track-1    99,107  23      100,100     29.9        0.0345
    current     focus-track-2   98,107  19      100,100     9.6         0.651
    09ba        long-track-1
    876c

    y-0 is center, y-0 is radius in a particular picture
    truth-y0 is established by hand - need a contour not a blob here

    record for each git commit, this will track all changes made in other utils as well
