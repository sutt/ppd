WINDOW POSITIONING

    tkinter opens to "second to last place" you moved it.
    Thus to get default to change:
        1. move it to where you want
        2. move it again slightly

    opencv associates window names with open positions

PYTHON

    dir(obj) shows all methods available to object

    signal.SIGALRM is available in wsl, but not windows
