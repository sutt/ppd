    How to get intellisense for cv2?

    add a dedicated tests folder
    add a dedicated /data/tests/
                                /benchmarks
                                /assets
    
    Write more tests for IterThresh
    more tests for single clrs

    Cleanup iter7
    cleanup logging, from stdout printing, so it can be used in tests

    Develop iter7 further:
        penalty needs to not include intital px_inrange cutoff
        
        more standardized return value
        make threshLo threshHi print prettier


BUGS:

    single color shouldnt cutoff px_inrange 

    single color doesnt work correctly above clr0

TO-DO:

    true gradient:
        only look back N spaces on x_i if current cheapest X is more advanced by 
        N-steps than x_i is
    
    add a console that communicates without waitKey thrashing

    add a unified way of calling into tests, resolving where data is, etc
