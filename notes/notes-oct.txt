    How to get intellisense for cv2?

    add a dedicated tests folder
    add a dedicated /data/tests/
                                /benchmarks
                                /assets
    
    Write more tests for IterThresh
    more tests for single clrs

    Cleanup iter7
    cleanup logging, from stdout printing, so it can be used in tests

    Develop iter7 further:
        penalty needs to not include intital px_inrange cutoff
        more standardized return value
        make threshLo threshHi print prettier


TO-DO:

    add a console that communicates without waitKey thrashing

    add a unified way of calling into tests, resolving where data is, etc
