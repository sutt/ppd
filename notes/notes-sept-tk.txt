Notes on Tk and how to debug:

Debug findings on 9/24:
    need to pause the program in the gui-thread:
    do this with breakpoints

    DO: set a breakpoint in the cmd_ function of GuiConstructor
    DONT: set a breakpoint in guiview, until program pauses.

    chosing your context as the gui thread, you can step-thru only that cmd_ function
    once you (hit a global?) the main thread will auto continue
    or you can chose main thread as your context and start stepping.
    this will cause gui-thread to immediately continue

note how globals get updated (or don't get updated) on these pauses:
    if gui-thread hadn't updated a global yet, then its not updated
    on the main thread, even after you step in main thread causing gui-thread
    to continue, you have to set main-thread to continue before you'll get
    the new global val

        FileDialog defines FileDialog, LoadFileDialog, SaveFileDialog. Here is an example:
            fdlg = FileDialog.LoadFileDialog(root, title="Choose A File")
                fname = fdlg.go() # opt args: dir_or_file=os.curdir, pattern="*", default="", key=None)
                if file == None: # user cancelled

What is Tcl? where is it on my box?

tk on my box:

    Run tests:
        C:\Python27\Lib\lib-tk\test\python runtktests.py
    
    check out this program:
        C:\Python27\Lib\lib-tk\turtle.py

    from idle TODO file:
        >>> from inspector import Tkinspect
        >>> Tkinspect(None, myObject)
        Tkinspect could probably be extended and refined to integrate better into IDLE.



I think tkinter worked out of the box on my python install?
