        "Extra modules"
        FileDialog defines FileDialog, LoadFileDialog, SaveFileDialog. Here is an example:
            fdlg = FileDialog.LoadFileDialog(root, title="Choose A File")
                fname = fdlg.go() # opt args: dir_or_file=os.curdir, pattern="*", default="", key=None)
                if file == None: # user cancelled

What is Tcl? where is it on my box?

tk on my box:

    Run tests:
        C:\Python27\Lib\lib-tk\test\python runtktests.py
    
    check out this program:
        C:\Python27\Lib\lib-tk\turtle.py

    from idle TODO file:
        >>> from inspector import Tkinspect
        >>> Tkinspect(None, myObject)
        Tkinspect could probably be extended and refined to integrate better into IDLE.



I think tkinter worked out of the box on my python install?
    Python 2.7.13
